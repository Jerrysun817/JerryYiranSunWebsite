          I have honed my skills as Software Engineer in the fast-paced world of
          tech innovation. I am proficient in languages including C/C++,
          JavaScript, Java, and Python, and frameworks like React and Node.js.
          Comfortable with Git, Linux/Unix like operating systems, and more. My
          career so far has been a rich tapestry of projects across various
          domains. The skills I've gathered, from web development, cloud
          infrastructure research to compiler development position me uniquely
          to contribute to different fields. I'm excited about future
          opportunities to apply my expertise in new and challenging
          environments.
